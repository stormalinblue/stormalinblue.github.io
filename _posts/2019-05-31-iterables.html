<p>The most familiar form of iterating to those accustomed to C-like languages is</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">for</span> (<span class="dt">int</span> i = <span class="dv">0</span>; i &lt; n; i += <span class="dv">1</span>) {
    <span class="co">// do something</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>The three parts of the for statement, the declaration, the comparison, and the comparision, are what people are accustomed to.</p>
<p>Some of the programming languages I know have the concept of an <em>iterable</em>, which is a nifty way to make all sorts of iterating more intuitive. However, for people who are more familiar with languages that emphasize the type of iteration used above, the concept can take time to get used to.</p>
<p>The above loop in Python would be</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="cf">for</span> i <span class="op">in</span> <span class="bu">range</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, n, <span class="dv">1</span>):
    <span class="co"># do something</span></code></pre></div>
